title: Machine Learning Clusters
---

A Machine Learning (ML) Cluster is a distributed computing environment for running machine learning workloads. Built on top of [Ray](https://docs.ray.io), a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications, it provides a distributed runtime, parallel processing, and a suite of AI libraries to accelerate ML tasks.

ML Clusters simplify the integration and deployment of Ray clusters with existing cluster tools, such as monitoring, logging, and GPU accelerators. This enables you to effortlessly manage both individual and end-to-end machine learning workflows, leveraging the following features:

- **Unified Dashboard:** Monitor and debug ML clusters, applications, and tasks from a single interface.
- **Unified API:** Run ML workloads on independent or shared ML clusters with a consistent API.
- **Scalable Libraries:** Access Ray libraries for common ML tasks, including data preprocessing, distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, reinforcement learning, and model serving.
- **Pythonic Distributed Computing:** Utilize distributed computing primitives to parallelize and scale Python applications.
