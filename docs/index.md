- **Complete Infrastructure & LLM Lifecycle Management:** Provides a unified interface for both developers and non-developers to manage the LLM infrastructure, ML Cluster, models and workloads.
- **Easy to use:** Build models and AI applications in your own way, without needing to managing Kubernetes & infrastructure directly.
- **Perfect for edge & branch:** better resource optimization, simplify the deployment of models and workloads to edge and branch networks, but can also scale up horizontally to handle large workloads.
